# Nuxt 3, Vue Composition API, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript Starter
## With Flowbite and the Nuxt Icons Module
After a lifetime of trying to choose a framework, I decided on Flowbite, mainly for the following reasons:
1. The whole point of tailwindcss is to be able to customise your html on the fly. For this, one needs access to the HTML component, so that components needs to be in your source
2. Flowbite has all the HTML on their website that you can copy and paste
3. The JavaScript is provided, as imports that you can use to manage your components.
4. It preconfigures some convenient data attributes such as ```data-modal-hide="modal"```
5. They also have a package called flowbite-vue that also contains the HTML - useful for more complex components such as the file input, etc
